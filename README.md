#Chat App

A chat application built using Flutter and Firebase. The app allows users to create and join groups to chat with other users.

##Features

User authentication: Users can register and log in to the app using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used for secure user authentication.

Group creation: Users can create their own groups and become administrators of those groups. They can set a name, description, and other settings for the group.

Group search and join: Users can search for groups by name or browse through a list of available groups. They can join any public group and start chatting with other group members.

Real-time chat: Once inside a group, users can send and receive messages in real-time. Firebase Cloud Firestore is used to store and synchronize messages across all devices.
